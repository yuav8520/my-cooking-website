<li><h4>Preparing the Crust:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, and melted butter. Mix until the crumbs are evenly coated.</li>
<li>Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan or a pie dish to create an even crust layer. You can use the back of a spoon or the bottom of a glass to help compact it.

</li>
<li>Place the crust in the refrigerator while you prepare the filling.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><h4>making the filling:</h4>
<ul>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form.</li>
<li>Add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract to the cream cheese and mix until well combined.</li>
<li>Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until it's fully incorporated, creating a smooth and airy filling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h4>now we assemble :)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove the crust from the refrigerator and pour the cheesecake filling over the crust.</li>
        <li>Smooth the top with a spatula to create an even surface.

        </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>  <h4>now we wait:</h4>
<ul><li>Cover the cheesecake with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and refrigerate for at least 4-6 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow it to set.</li></ul>
</li>
<li><h4>final touches</h4>
<ul>
<li>Before serving, you can add your choice of toppings. Fresh berries, fruit compote, chocolate chips, or whipped cream are popular options.</li>
<li>Carefully remove the cheesecake from the springform pan (if using) and slice into portions.</li>
<li>Serve chilled and enjoy your delicious no-bake cheesecake!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This no-bake cheesecake is a crowd-pleaser and is perfect for any occasion. It's creamy, rich, and doesn't require an oven, making it a great dessert option when you want to keep things simple.
