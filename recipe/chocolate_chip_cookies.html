    <p style="font-size: 26px;"><em>Ingredients:</em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup (2 sticks or 226 grams) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150 grams) packed brown sugar (light or dark)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups (280 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups (about 340 grams) semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-size: 26px;"><em>Instructions:</em></p>
    <ol>
        
    <li><strong style="font-size: 18px;">the Oven:</strong>  Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>     
    <li><strong style="font-size: 18px;">Cream the Butter and Sugars:</strong>  In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes with an electric mixer.</li>     
    <li><strong style="font-size: 18px;">Add Eggs and Vanilla:</strong> Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Then, mix in the vanilla extract.</li>     
    <li><strong style="font-size: 18px;">Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>     
    <li><strong style="font-size: 18px;">Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong> Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients in the large mixing bowl. Mix until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; you want the dough to come together, but overmixing can make the cookies tough.</li>     
    <li><strong style="font-size: 18px;">Add Chocolate Chips:</strong> Gently fold in the semisweet chocolate chips until they are evenly distributed throughout the cookie dough.</li>     
    <li><strong style="font-size: 18px;">Form Cookie Dough Balls:</strong> Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each cookie for them to spread while baking.</li>     
    <li><strong style="font-size: 18px;">Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden but the centers are still soft. The cookies will continue to cook a bit after you remove them from the oven due to the residual heat, so be careful not to overbake.</li>     
    <li><strong style="font-size: 18px;">Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy your homemade chocolate chip cookies!</li>
<p style="font-size:18px ;">feel free to customize your cookies by adding nuts, different types of chocolate chips, or even a sprinkle of sea salt on top for a delicious twist. These cookies are best enjoyed warm with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage.</p>
