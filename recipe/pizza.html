<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<h4>For the Pizza Dough:</h4>

<p>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.

   <ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
<li>Stir the ingredients together until a dough forms.</li>
<li> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. You can also use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment for this step.</li>
<li>  Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>  
   </ol> 
    </p>
<h4>For the Pizza Sauce:</h4>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li> In a small saucepan, heat a bit of olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.        </li>
        <li> Add the crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens.</li>
        <li> Remove the sauce from heat and set it aside.</li>
    </ol> 
   </p>

<h4>Putting It All Together:</h4>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.
        </li>
        <li>Punch down the risen pizza dough and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out each portion into a 12-inch circle on a floured surface.
        </li>
<li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel or an inverted baking sheet that's been dusted with cornmeal or flour to prevent sticking.
</li>
<li>Spread a generous amount of the pizza sauce over each dough round, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.
</li>
<li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
<li>Carefully transfer the pizzas onto the preheated pizza stone or onto a baking sheet if you're not using a stone.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.
    </li>
    <li>Remove the pizzas from the oven and let them cool for a minute before slicing. Enjoy your homemade pizza!
