    <h3> this is the classic Spaghetti Aglio e Olio, which is a traditional Italian pasta dish:</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces (about 225 grams) of spaghetti</li>
        <li>4-5 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced or minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley </li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions:    </h4>
    <ol>
<li><em>Boil the Spaghetti:</em>
    <p>Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the package instructions until al dente. This usually takes about 8-10 minutes. Reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water before draining.</p>
</li>
<li><em>Saut√© the Garlic: </em>
    <p>While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over low heat. Add the sliced garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook the garlic gently, stirring occasionally, until it turns golden brown and fragrant. Be careful not to burn it; it should take about 3-4 minutes. Adjust the heat as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <em>Combine Pasta and Garlic Oil:</em>
    <p>Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it to the skillet with the garlic oil. Toss the pasta to coat it evenly with the garlic-infused oil. If the pasta seems dry, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water a little at a time until you reach your desired consistency. Season generously with salt and black pepper.</p>
</li>
<li><em>Finish and Serve: </em>
<p> If desired, sprinkle the chopped fresh parsley over the pasta for a burst of freshness and color. You can also top each serving with grated Parmesan cheese for extra flavor.</p></li>
</ol>
